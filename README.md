## Process and objectives

The layout and the base repository was provided by Rocketseat and as a step on the Bootcamp, they threw a challenge to the students to develop the main component of this ecommerce.
The challenge have tests with Jest and react testing library to garantee that we achieve the goal.
The main goal was to build a custom hook using react context.
Manage the cart, removing, adding, and updating products. And putting on localStorage the state to be kept and initialize.
